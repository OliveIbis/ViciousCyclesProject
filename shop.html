         <p>Vicious Cycle products can be purchased/ordered at our store. Come down today and we'll get started with a purchase of an existing bike with cash, credit, or in-house loan approval.</p>
        <aside>All custom builds will require a 25% down payment before projects will begin, and either payment in full, or an approved in-house loan, or a transfer of funds to a third-party vendor. All purchases on custom cycles are final.</aside>
